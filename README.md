## 📊 Models Evaluated
The following models were tested and compared:
- Linear Regression  
- Lasso Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Gradient Boosting Regressor  

Cross-validation (5 folds) was used to ensure the model's stability and to avoid overfitting.
